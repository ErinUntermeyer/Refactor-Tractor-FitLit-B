# Refactor Tractor: Fit-Lit

#### Group Project from Thurs 7/16/2020 - Tue 7/28/2020 in Module 2 at Turing School of Software and Design

## About

FitLit is an activity tracker, very similar to the popular Fitbit device. This application allows a user to view their latest hydration, sleep and activity data for the most recent day, as well as trends for the most recent week.

In this project, we were to refactor a pre-existing codebase for an almost-completed FitLit, as well as learn how to implement new technologies (Webpack, Fetch, SCSS and chai-spies).
